					<h4>Our Mission</h4>
					<p>We set out in our summer JBS program at Brandeis University to make a voice interactive cooking app.
						We wanted a user to have good visual and auditory cues while cooking a recipe so that they never had to skim through
					a cookbook or scroll through annoying text while cooking (possibly with messing hands)</p>
					<hr>
					<h4>How To Use Cookie</h4>
					<p>On a recipe page you can say "Cookie" to get her to listen for a command or question. You will see the recording
					dot at the top of the page turn red when she is listening, then you can ask for "next step" or "previous step,"
					to "repeat," or to "list ingredients." We are adding new voice features, so check back here for any updates.</p>
